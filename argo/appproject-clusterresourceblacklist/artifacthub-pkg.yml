description: >-
  An AppProject may optionally specify clusterResourceBlacklist which is a blacklisted group of cluster resources. This is often a good practice to ensure AppProjects do not allow more access than needed. This policy is a combination of two rules which enforce that all AppProjects specify clusterResourceBlacklist and that their group and kind have wildcards as values.
