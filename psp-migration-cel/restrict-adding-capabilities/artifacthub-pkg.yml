displayName: Restrict Adding Capabilities in CEL expressions
description: >-
  Adding capabilities is a way for containers in a Pod to request higher levels of ability than those with which they may be provisioned. Many capabilities allow system-level control and should be prevented. Pod Security Policies (PSP) allowed a list of "good" capabilities to be added. This policy checks ephemeralContainers, initContainers, and containers to ensure the only capabilities that can be added are either NET_BIND_SERVICE or CAP_CHOWN.
