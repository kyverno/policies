      Adding capabilities is a way for containers in a Pod to request higher levels
      of ability than those with which they may be provisioned. Many capabilities
      allow system-level control and should be prevented. Pod Security Policies (PSP)
      allowed a list of "good" capabilities to be added. This policy checks
      ephemeralContainers, initContainers, and containers to ensure the only
      capabilities that can be added are either NET_BIND_SERVICE or CAP_CHOWN.
