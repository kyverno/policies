displayName: Block cluster-admin from modifying any object in a Namespace
createdAt: "2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z"
description: >-
  In some cases, it may be desirable to block operations of certain privileged users (i.e. cluster-admins) in a specific namespace. In this policy, Kyverno will look for all user operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE), on every object kind, in the testnamespace namespace, and for the ClusterRole cluster-admin. The user testuser is also mentioned so it won't include all the cluster-admins in the cluster, but will be flexible enough to apply only for a sub-group of the cluster-admins in the cluster.
