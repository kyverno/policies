displayName: Advanced Restrict Image Registries in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  In instances where a ValidatingPolicy defines all the approved image registries is insufficient, more granular control may be needed to set permitted registries, especially in multi-tenant use cases where some registries may be based on the Namespace. This policy shows an advanced version of the Restrict Image Registries policy which gets a global approved registry from a ConfigMap and, based upon an annotation at the Namespace level, gets the registry approved for that Namespace.
