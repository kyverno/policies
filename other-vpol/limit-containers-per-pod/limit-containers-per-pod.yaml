    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pods can have many different containers which
      are tightly coupled. It may be desirable to limit the amount of containers that
      can be in a single Pod to control best practice application or so policy can
      be applied consistently. This policy checks all Pods to ensure they have
      no more than four containers.
