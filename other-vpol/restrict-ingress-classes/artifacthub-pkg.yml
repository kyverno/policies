version: 1.0.0
displayName: Restrict Ingress Classes in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Ingress classes should only be allowed which match up to deployed Ingress controllers in the cluster. Allowing users to define classes which cannot be satisfied by a deployed Ingress controller can result in either no or undesired functionality. This policy checks Ingress resources and only allows those which define `HAProxy` or `nginx` in the respective annotation. This annotation has largely been replaced as of Kubernetes 1.18 with the IngressClass resource.
