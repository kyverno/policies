displayName: Restrict Annotations in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Some annotations control functionality driven by other cluster-wide tools and are not normally set by some class of users. This policy prevents the use of an annotation beginning with `fluxcd.io/`. This can be useful to ensure users either don't set reserved annotations or to force them to use a newer version of an annotation.
