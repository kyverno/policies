displayName: Spread Pods Across Nodes & Zones in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Deployments to a Kubernetes cluster with multiple availability zones often need to distribute those replicas to align with those zones to ensure site-level failures do not impact availability. This policy ensures topologySpreadConstraints are defined,  to spread pods over nodes and zones. Deployments or Statefulsets with leass than 3  replicas are skipped.
