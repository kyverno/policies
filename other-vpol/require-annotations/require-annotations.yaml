      Define and use annotations that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
      A common set of annotations allows tools to work collaboratively, describing objects in a common manner that
      all tools can understand. The recommended annotations describe applications in a way that can be
      queried. This policy validates that the annotation `corp.org/department` is specified with some value.
