displayName: Metadata Matches Regex in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Rather than a simple check to see if given metadata such as labels and annotations are present, in some cases they need to be present and the values match a specified regular expression. This policy illustrates how to ensure a label with key `corp.org/version` is both present and matches a given regex, in this case ensuring semver is met.
