displayName: Require Non-Root Groups in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Containers should be forbidden from running with a root primary or supplementary GID. This policy ensures the `runAsGroup`, `supplementalGroups`, and `fsGroup` fields are set to a number greater than zero (i.e., non root). A known issue prevents a policy such as this using `anyPattern` from being persisted properly in Kubernetes 1.23.0-1.23.2.
