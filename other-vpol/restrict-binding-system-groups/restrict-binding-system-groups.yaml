    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Certain system groups exist in Kubernetes which grant permissions that
      are used for certain system-level functions yet typically never appropriate
      for other users. This policy prevents creating bindings to some of these
      groups including system:anonymous, system:unauthenticated, and system:masters.
