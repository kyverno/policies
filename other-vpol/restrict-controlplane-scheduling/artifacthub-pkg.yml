displayName: Restrict control plane scheduling in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Scheduling non-system Pods to control plane nodes (which run kubelet) is often undesirable because it takes away resources from the control plane components and can represent a possible security threat vector. This policy prevents users from setting a toleration in a Pod spec which allows running on control plane nodes with the taint key `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`.
