    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Ingress hosts optionally accept a wildcard as an alternative
      to precise matching. In some cases, this may be too permissive as it
      would direct unintended traffic to the given Ingress resource. This
      policy enforces that any Ingress host does not contain a wildcard
      character.
