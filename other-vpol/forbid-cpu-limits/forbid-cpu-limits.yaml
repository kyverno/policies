      Setting of CPU limits is a debatable poor practice as it can result, when defined, in potentially starving
      applications of much-needed CPU cycles even when they are available. Ensuring that CPU limits are not
      set may ensure apps run more effectively. This policy forbids any container in a Pod from defining CPU limits.
