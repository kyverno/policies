    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pods not created by workload controllers such as Deployments
      have no self-healing or scaling abilities and are unsuitable for production.
      This policy prevents such "bare" Pods from being created unless they originate
      from a higher-level workload controller of some sort.
