version: 1.0.0
displayName: Unique Ingress Path
description: >-
  Just like the need to ensure uniqueness among Ingress hosts, there is a need to have the paths be unique as well. This policy checks an incoming Ingress to ensure its root path does not conflict with another root path in a different Namespace. It requires that incoming Ingress resources have a single rule with a single path only and assumes the root path is specified explicitly in an existing Ingress rule (ex., when blocking /foo/bar /foo must exist by itself and not part of /foo/baz).
