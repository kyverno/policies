description: >-
  This policy ensures that Ingress resources do not have certain disallowed annotations and that the ingress-nginx controller pod is running an appropriate version of the image. It checks for the presence of the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet` annotation and disallows its usage, enforces specific values for `auth-tls-verify-client`, and ensures that the ingress-nginx controller image is of the required version.
