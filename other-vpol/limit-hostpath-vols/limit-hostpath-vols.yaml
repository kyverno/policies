    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      hostPath volumes consume the underlying node's file system. If hostPath volumes
      are not to be universally disabled, they should be restricted to only certain
      host paths so as not to allow access to sensitive information. This policy ensures
      the only directory that can be mounted as a hostPath volume is /data. It is strongly
      recommended to pair this policy with a second to ensure readOnly
      access is enforced preventing directory escape.
