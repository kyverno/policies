      In order for Velero to backup volumes in a Pod using an opt-in approach, it
      requires an annotation on the Pod called `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` with the
      value being a comma-separated list of the volumes mounted to that Pod. This policy
      automatically annotates Pods (and Pod controllers) which refer to a PVC so that
      all volumes are listed in the aforementioned annotation if a Namespace with the label
      `velero-backup-pvc=true`.
