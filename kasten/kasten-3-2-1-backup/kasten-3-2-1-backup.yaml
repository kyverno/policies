    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The 3-2-1 rule of data protection recommends that you have at least 3 copies of data, on 2 different storage targets, with 1 being offsite. This approach ensures a health mix of redundancy options for data recovery of the application for localized & multi-region cloud failures or compromise. In Kubernetes, this translates to the original running resources, a local snapshot, and a copy of all application resources and volume data exported to an external repository.
      This policy accomplishes 3-2-1 validation by ensuring each policy contains both 'action: backup' and 'action: export'.
