description: >-
  Generates a Kasten policy for a namespace that includes any Deployment or StatefulSet with a "dataprotection=kasten-example" label, if the policy does not already exist. This Kyverno policy can be used in combination with the "kasten-data-protection-by-label" policy to require "dataprotection" labeling on workloads. NOTE: Use of this policy will require granting the Kyverno background-controller additional privileges required to generate Kasten resources. An example ClusterRole to provide required privileges is provided within the comments of the policy manifest.
