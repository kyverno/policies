description: >-
  A PodDisruptionBudget limits the number of Pods of a replicated application that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. For example, a quorum-based application would like to ensure that the number of replicas running is never brought below the number needed for a quorum. As an application owner, you can create a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) for each application. This policy will create a PDB resource whenever a new Deployment is created.
