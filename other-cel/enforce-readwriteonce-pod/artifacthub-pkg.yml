version: 1.0.0
displayName: Enforce readwriteoncepod in CEL expressions
description: >-
      Some stateful workloads with multiple replicas only allow a single Pod to write
      to a given volume at a time. Beginning in Kubernetes 1.22 and enabled by default
      in 1.27, a new setting called ReadWriteOncePod, available
      for CSI volumes only, allows volumes to be writable from only a single Pod. For more
      information see the blog https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/20/read-write-once-pod-access-mode-beta/.
      This policy enforces that the accessModes for a PersistentVolumeClaim be set to ReadWriteOncePod.
