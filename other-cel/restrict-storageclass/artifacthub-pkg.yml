  StorageClasses allow description of custom "classes" of storage offered by the cluster, based on quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or custom policies determined by the cluster administrators. For shared StorageClasses in a multi-tenancy environment, a reclaimPolicy of `Delete` should be used to ensure a PersistentVolume cannot be reused across Namespaces. This policy requires StorageClasses set a reclaimPolicy of `Delete`.
