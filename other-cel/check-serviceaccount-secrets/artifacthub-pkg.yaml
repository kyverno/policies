displayName: Check Existence of Secrets in ServiceAccount in CEL expressions
description: >-
  Before version 1.24, Kubernetes automatically generated Secret-based tokens 
  for ServiceAccounts. To distinguish between automatically generated tokens 
  and manually created ones, Kubernetes checks for a reference from the 
  ServiceAccount's secrets field. If the Secret is referenced in the secrets 
  field, it is considered an auto-generated legacy token. These legacy Tokens can
  be of security concern and should be audited.
