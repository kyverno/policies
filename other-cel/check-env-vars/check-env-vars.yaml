      Environment variables control many aspects of a container's execution and are
      often the source of many different configuration settings. Being able to ensure that
      the value of a specific environment variable either is or is not set to a specific string
      is useful to maintain such controls. This policy checks every container to ensure that if the
      `DISABLE_OPA` environment variable is defined, it must not be set to a value of `"true"`.
