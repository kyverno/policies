displayName: Check Environment Variables in CEL expressions
description: >-
  Environment variables control many aspects of a container's execution and are often the source of many different configuration settings. Being able to ensure that the value of a specific environment variable either is or is not set to a specific string is useful to maintain such controls. This policy checks every container to ensure that if the `DISABLE_OPA` environment variable is defined, it must not be set to a value of `"true"`.
