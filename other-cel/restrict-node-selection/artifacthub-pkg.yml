description: >-
  The Kubernetes scheduler uses complex logic to determine the optimal placement for new Pods. Users who have access to set certain fields in a Pod spec may sidestep this logic which in many cases is undesirable. This policy prevents users from targeting specific Nodes for scheduling of Pods by prohibiting the use of the `nodeSelector` and `nodeName` fields. Note that this policy is only designed to work on initial creation and not in background mode.
