displayName: Restrict Edit for Endpoints CVE-2021-25740 in CEL expressions
description: >-
  Clusters not initially installed with Kubernetes 1.22 may be vulnerable to an issue defined in CVE-2021-25740 which could enable users to send network traffic to locations they would otherwise not have access to via a confused deputy attack. This was due to the system:aggregate-to-edit ClusterRole having edit permission of Endpoints. This policy, intended to run in background mode, checks if your cluster is vulnerable to CVE-2021-25740 by ensuring the system:aggregate-to-edit ClusterRole does not have the edit permission of Endpoints.
