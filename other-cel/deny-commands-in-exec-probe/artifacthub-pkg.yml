  Developers may feel compelled to use simple shell commands as a workaround to creating "proper" liveness or readiness probes for a Pod. Such a practice can be discouraged via detection of those commands. This policy prevents the use of certain commands `jcmd`, `ps`, or `ls` if found in a Pod's liveness exec probe.
