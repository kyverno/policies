    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster are allowed to communicate with each other, and all
      network traffic is unencrypted. It is recommended to not use an empty podSelector in order to
      more closely control the necessary traffic flows. This policy requires that all NetworkPolicies
      other than that of `default-deny` not use an empty podSelector.
