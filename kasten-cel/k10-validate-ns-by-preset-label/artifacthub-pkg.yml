description: >-
  Kubernetes applications are typically deployed into a single, logical namespace. Kasten K10 policies will discover and protect all resources within the selected namespace(s). This policy ensures all new namespaces include a label referencing a valid K10 SLA (Policy Preset) for data protection. This policy can be used in combination with generate ClusterPolicy to automatically create a K10 policy based on the specified SLA. The combination ensures that new applications are not inadvertently left unprotected.
