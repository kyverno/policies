  According to EKS best practices, the `aws-node` DaemonSet is configured to use a role assigned to the EC2 instances to assign IPs to Pods. This role includes several AWS managed policies that effectively allow all Pods running on a Node to attach/detach ENIs, assign/unassign IP addresses, or pull images from ECR. Since this presents a risk to your cluster, it is recommended that you update the `aws-node` DaemonSet to use IRSA. This policy ensures that the `aws-node` DaemonSet running in the `kube-system` Namespace is not still using the `aws-node` ServiceAccount.
