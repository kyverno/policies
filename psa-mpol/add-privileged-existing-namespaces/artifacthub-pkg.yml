description: >-
  When Pod Security Admission is configured with a cluster-wide AdmissionConfiguration file which sets either baseline or restricted, for example in many PaaS CIS profiles, it may be necessary to relax this to privileged on a per-Namespace basis so that more granular control can be provided. This policy labels new and existing Namespaces, except that of kube-system, with the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged` label.
