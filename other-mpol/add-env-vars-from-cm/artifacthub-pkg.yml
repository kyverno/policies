description: >-
  Instead of defining a common set of environment variables multiple times either in manifests or separate policies, Pods can reference entire collections stored in a ConfigMap. This policy mutates all initContainers (if present) and containers in a Pod with environment variables defined in a ConfigMap named `nsenvvars` that must exist in the destination Namespace.
