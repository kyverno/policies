description: >-
  A Pod securityContext entry defines fields such as the user and group which should be used to run the Pod. Sometimes choosing default values for users rather than blocking is a better alternative to not impede such Pod definitions. This policy will mutate a Pod to set `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, and `fsGroup` fields within the Pod securityContext if they are not already set.
