description: >-
  When a Pod requests an emptyDir, by default it does not have a size limit which may allow it to consume excess or all of the space in the medium backing the volume. This can quickly overrun a Node and may result in a denial of service for other workloads. This policy adds a sizeLimit field to all Pods mounting emptyDir volumes, if not present, and sets it to 100Mi.
