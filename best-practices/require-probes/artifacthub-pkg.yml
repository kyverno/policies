description: >-
  Liveness and readiness probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. For each Pod, a periodic `livenessProbe` is performed by the kubelet to determine if the Pod's containers are running or need to be restarted. A `readinessProbe` is used by Services and Deployments to determine if the Pod is ready to receive network traffic. This policy validates that all containers have one of livenessProbe, readinessProbe, or startupProbe defined.
