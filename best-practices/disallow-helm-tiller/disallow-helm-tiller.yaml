      Tiller, found in Helm v2, has known security challenges. It requires administrative privileges and acts as a shared
      resource accessible to any authenticated user. Tiller can lead to privilege escalation as
      restricted users can impact other users. It is recommended to use Helm v3+ which does not contain
      Tiller for these reasons. This policy validates that there is not an image
      containing the name `tiller`.
