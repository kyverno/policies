      Container daemon socket bind mounts allows access to the container engine on the
      node. This access can be used for privilege escalation and to manage containers
      outside of Kubernetes, and hence should not be allowed. This policy validates that
      the sockets used for CRI engines Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O are not used.
