      Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. The
      CAP_NET_RAW capability, enabled by default, allows processes in a container to
      forge packets and bind to any interface potentially leading to MitM attacks.
      This policy ensures that all containers explicitly drop the CAP_NET_RAW
      ability.
