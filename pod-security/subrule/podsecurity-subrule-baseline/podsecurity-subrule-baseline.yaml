      The baseline profile of the Pod Security Standards is a collection of the
      most basic and important steps that can be taken to secure Pods. Beginning
      with Kyverno 1.8, an entire profile may be assigned to the cluster through a
      single rule. This policy configures the baseline profile through the latest
      version of the Pod Security Standards cluster wide.
