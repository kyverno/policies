    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The restricted profile of the Pod Security Standards, which is inclusive of
      the baseline profile, is a collection of all the most common configurations
      that can be taken to secure Pods. Beginning with Kyverno 1.8, an entire profile
      may be assigned to the cluster through a single rule. In some cases, specific exemptions
      must be made on a per-control basis. This policy configures the
      restricted profile through the latest version of the Pod Security Standards cluster wide while
      exempting `nginx` and `redis` container images from the Capabilities control check.
