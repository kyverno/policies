description: >-
  The restricted profile of the Pod Security Standards, which is inclusive of the baseline profile, is a collection of all the most common configurations that can be taken to secure Pods. Beginning with Kyverno 1.8, an entire profile may be assigned to the cluster through a single rule. In some cases, specific exemptions must be made on a per-control basis. This policy configures the restricted profile through the latest version of the Pod Security Standards cluster wide while completely exempting Seccomp control check.
