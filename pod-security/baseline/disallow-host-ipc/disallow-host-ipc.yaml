    policies.kyverno.io/description:
      Sharing the host's PID namespace allows visibility of process
      on the host, potentially exposing process information. Sharing the host's IPC namespace allows
      the container process to communicate with processes on the host. To avoid pod container from
      having visibility to host process space, validate that 'hostPID' and 'hostIPC' are set to 'false'.
