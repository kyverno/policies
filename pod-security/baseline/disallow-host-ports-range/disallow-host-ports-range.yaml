      Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should not be
      allowed by requiring host ports be undefined (recommended) or at minimum restricted to a known list.
      This policy ensures the `hostPort` field, if defined, is set to either a port in the specified range
      or to a value of zero. This policy is mutually exclusive of the disallow-host-ports policy.
      Note that Kubernetes Pod Security Admission does not support the host port range rule.
