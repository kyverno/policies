description: >-
  Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should not be allowed by requiring host ports be undefined (recommended) or at minimum restricted to a known list. This policy ensures the `hostPort` field, if defined, is set to either a port in the specified range or to a value of zero. This policy is mutually exclusive of the disallow-host-ports policy. Note that Kubernetes Pod Security Admission does not support the host port range rule.
