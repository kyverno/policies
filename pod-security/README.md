# Pod Security Standards

These are collections of policies which implement the various levels of Kubernetes [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/). The Baseline/Default profile is minimally restrictive and denies the most common vulnerabilities while the Restricted profile is more heavily restrictive but follows many more of the common security best practices for Pods.
