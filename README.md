# Policies

This repository contains Kyverno policies for a wide array of usage on various Kubernetes and ecosystem resources and subjects. For the optimal searching and browsing experience, please see [Usage and Documentation](##usage-and-documentation). For guidance on how you can contribute your own, please see [Contribution](##contribution). To request a Kyverno policy be created which doesn't exist, please see [Policy Requests](##policy-requests).

## Usage and Documentation

See https://kyverno.io/policies/ for a list of all the policies represented here in a simplified list with easy filtering abilities.

## Contribution

Anyone and everyone is welcome to write and contribute Kyverno policies! We have standardized on several practices to ensure these policies are effective, descriptive, and assist in easy location on the website. Please follow these guidelines when contributing a policy.

* Use the [Kyverno annotations](https://github.com/kyverno/policies/wiki/Kyverno-annotations) to mark your policy with descriptive metadata. This is not only important to explain your policy, but to allow the filtering logic on the [policies page](https://kyverno.io/policies/) to work effectively.

* Name your policy something descriptive which matches its function.

* Provide test resources (where possible) which allow your policy to be validated using the Kyverno CLI. See an example of a complete policy, resource, and test [here](https://github.com/kyverno/policies/tree/main/pod-security/baseline/disallow-adding-capabilities). If unfamiliar with the Kyverno CLI and its test ability, please see the documentation [here](https://kyverno.io/docs/testing-policies/).

* For `validate` rules, please set `validationFailureAction: audit` so that should a user download and apply the policy without having a yet full understanding of Kyverno, it will not cause unintended harm to their environment by blocking resources.

* String values do not need to be quoted nor do values which contain JMESPath expressions such as `{{request.operation}}`. The exception is if a field's value is *only* such an expression. In those cases, the JMESPath expression needs to be double quoted.

Once your policy is written within these guidelines and tested, please open a standard PR against the `main` branch of kyverno/policies. In order for a policy to make it to the website's [policies page](https://kyverno.io/policies/), it must first be committed to the `main` branch in this repo. Following that, an administrator will render these policies to produce Markdown files in a second PR. You do not need to worry about this process, however.

## Policy Requests

If you're not yet comfortable with Kyverno and would like to see a policy that may not presently exist, or if you're having trouble crafting that perfect policy, a couple resources exist. The most expedient way to get help may be to post on [Kyverno Slack](https://kyverno.io/community/). Kyverno has a rich and active community with its members and maintainers ready to assist. You may also [open an issue](https://github.com/kyverno/policies/issues) to request a certain policy be created to satisfy your needs. If going this route, do keep a few things in mind.

* Clearly explain in detail your use case for *why* you need a policy which isn't present on the [policies page](https://kyverno.io/policies/).

* Explain what you want this policy to do and on what resources.

* If applicable, explain what other policies and/or steps you have taken yourself that have been unsuccessful.

* Be responsive to the GitHub issue if further follow-up is required by the contributors or maintainers.

Having this information up front will assist others in crafting a policy to meet your needs.
