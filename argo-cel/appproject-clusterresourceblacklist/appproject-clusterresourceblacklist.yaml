    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      An AppProject may optionally specify clusterResourceBlacklist which is a blacklisted
      group of cluster resources. This is often a good practice to ensure AppProjects do
      not allow more access than needed. This policy is a combination of two rules which
      enforce that all AppProjects specify clusterResourceBlacklist and that their group
      and kind have wildcards as values.
