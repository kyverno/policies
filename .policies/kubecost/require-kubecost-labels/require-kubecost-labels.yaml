      Kubecost can use labels assigned to Pods in order to track and display
      cost allocation in a granular way. These labels, which can be customized, can be used
      to organize and group workloads in different ways. This policy requires that the labels
      `owner`, `team`, `department`, `app`, and `env` are all defined on Pods. With Kyverno
      autogen enabled (absence of the annotation `pod-policies.kyverno.io/autogen-controllers=none`),
      these labels will also be required for all Pod controllers.
