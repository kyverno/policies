description: >-
  Kubecost can use labels assigned to Pods in order to track and display cost allocation in a granular way. These labels, which can be customized, can be used to organize and group workloads in different ways. This policy requires that the labels `owner`, `team`, `department`, `app`, and `env` are all defined on Pods. With Kyverno autogen enabled (absence of the annotation `pod-policies.kyverno.io/autogen-controllers=none`), these labels will also be required for all Pod controllers.
