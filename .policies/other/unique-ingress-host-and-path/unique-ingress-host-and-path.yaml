    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Similar to the ability to check the uniqueness of hosts and paths independently,
      it is possible to check for uniqueness of them both together across a cluster.
      This policy ensures that no Ingress can be created or updated unless it is
      globally unique with respect to host plus path combination.
