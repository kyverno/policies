      A Pod may optionally specify a priorityClassName which indicates the scheduling
      priority relative to others. This requires creation of a PriorityClass object in advance.
      With this created, a Pod may set this field to that value. In a multi-tenant environment,
      it is often desired to require this priorityClassName be set to make certain tenant
      scheduling guarantees. This policy requires that a Pod defines the priorityClassName field
      with some value.
