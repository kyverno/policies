    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
          In some cases we would want to block operations (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) of certain privileged users (i.e. cluster-admins), in a specific namespace.
          In this policy, Kyverno look for all user operations (`CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE`), on every object kind (Pod,Deployment,Route,Service,etc.), in the testnamespace namespace, and for the `clusterRole cluster-admin`. The `subject User testuser` is also mentioned so it wonâ€™t include all the cluster-admins in the cluster, but will be flexiable enough to apply only for a sub-group of the cluster-admins in the cluster.
