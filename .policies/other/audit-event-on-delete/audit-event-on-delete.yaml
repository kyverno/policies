      Kubernetes Events are limited in that the circumstances under which they are created
      cannot be changed and with what they are associated is fixed. It may be advantageous
      in many cases to augment these out-of-the-box Events with custom Events which can be
      custom designed to your needs. This policy generates an Event when a Secret has been
      deleted. It lists the userInfo of the actor performing the deletion.
