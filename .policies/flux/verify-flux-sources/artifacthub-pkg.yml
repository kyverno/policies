description: >-
  Flux source APIs include a number of different sources such as GitRepository, Bucket, HelmRepository, and ImageRepository resources. Each of these by default can be pointed to any location. In a production environment, it may be desired to restrict these to only known sources to prevent accessing outside sources. This policy verifies that each of the Flux sources comes from a trusted location.
