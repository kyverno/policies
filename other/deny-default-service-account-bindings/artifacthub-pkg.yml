description: >-
  The default service account is automatically mounted into all pods in a namespace unless explicitly overridden. If this account is bound to a Role or ClusterRole that grants extensive permissions, every pod in the namespace using the default service account will inherit these permissions. This setup can lead to unnecessary security risks if a pod is compromised, as an attacker could potentially gain access to other resources within the cluster.For an enhnaced security, using the default service account in RoleBindings is not recommended.
