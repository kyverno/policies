      The default service account is automatically mounted into all pods in a namespace unless 
      explicitly overridden. If this account is bound to a Role or ClusterRole that grants extensive 
      permissions, every pod in the namespace using the default service account will inherit these 
      permissions. This setup can lead to unnecessary security risks if a pod is compromised, as an 
      attacker could potentially gain access to other resources within the cluster.For an enhnaced 
      security, using the default service account in RoleBindings is not recommended.
