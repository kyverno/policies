description: >-
  Users may be able to specify any ServiceAccount which exists in their Namespace without restrictions. Confining Pods to a list of authorized ServiceAccounts can be useful to ensure applications in those Pods do not have more privileges than they should. This policy verifies that in the `staging` Namespace the ServiceAccount being specified is matched based on the image and name of the container. For example: 'sa-name: ["registry/image-name"]'
