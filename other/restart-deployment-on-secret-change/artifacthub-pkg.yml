description: >-
  If Secrets are mounted in ways which do not naturally allow updates to be live refreshed it may be necessary to modify a Deployment. This policy watches a Secret and if it changes will write an annotation to one or more target Deployments thus triggering a new rollout and thereby refreshing the referred Secret. It may be necessary to grant additional privileges to the Kyverno ServiceAccount, via one of the existing ClusterRoleBindings or a new one, so it can modify Deployments.
