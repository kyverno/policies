displayName: Add ConfigMap Owner Reference from ReplicaSet
createdAt: "2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z"
description: >-
  When a new ReplicaSet is created (typically by updating a Deployment), 
  this policy will automatically add an owner reference to any ConfigMaps 
  that the ReplicaSet mounts as volumes. This ensures that ConfigMaps have 
  proper ownership relationships with the ReplicaSets that use them, which 
  can be useful for garbage collection, monitoring, and dependency tracking.
  This policy requires additional RBAC permissions for Kyverno to update ConfigMaps.
