description: >-
  Cases where RBAC may be applied at a higher level and where Namespace-level protections may be necessary can be accomplished with a separate policy. For example, one may want to protect creates, updates, and deletes on only a single Namespace. This policy will block creates, updates, and deletes to any Namespace labeled with `freeze=true`. Caution should be exercised when using rules which match on all kinds (`"*"`) as this will involve, for larger clusters, a substantial amount of processing on Kyverno's part. Additional resource requests and/or limits may be required.
