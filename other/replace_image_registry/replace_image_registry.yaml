      Rather than blocking Pods which come from outside registries,
      it is also possible to mutate them so the pulls are directed to
      approved registries. In some cases, those registries may function as
      pull-through proxies and can fetch the image if not cached.
      This policy policy mutates all images either
      in the form 'image:tag' or 'registry.corp.com/image:tag' to be prefaced
      with `myregistry.corp.com/`.
