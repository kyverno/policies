    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Kubernetes RBAC allows for controls on kinds of resources or those
      with specific names. This policy restricts updates and deletes to any
      Service resource that contains the label `protected="true"` unless by
      a cluster-admin and thus functions as a more granular option to
      Kubernetes RBAC.
