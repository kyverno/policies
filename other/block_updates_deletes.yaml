    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Kubernetes RBAC allows for controls on kinds of resources or those
      with specific names. But it does not have the type of granularity often
      required in more complex environments. This sample restricts updates and deletes to any
      Service resource that contains the label `protected=true` unless by
      a cluster-admin.
