      Pods may use several mechanisms to prefer scheduling on a set of nodes,
      and nodeAffinity is one of them. nodeAffinity uses expressions to select
      eligible nodes for scheduling decisions and may override intended placement
      options by cluster administrators. This policy ensures that nodeAffinity
      is not used in a Pod spec.
