description: >-
  In some cases a validation check for one type of resource may need to take into consideration the requesting user's permissions on a different type of resource. Rather than parsing through all Roles and/or ClusterRoles to check if these permissions are held, Kyverno can perform a SubjectAccessReview request to the Kubernetes API server and have it figure out those permissions. This policy illustrates how to perform a POST request to the API server to subject a SubjectAccessReview for a user creating/updating a ConfigMap. It is intended to be used as a component in a more functional rule.
