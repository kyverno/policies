    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Applications may involve multiple replicas of the same Pod for availability as well as scale
      purposes, yet Kubernetes does not by default provide a solution for availability. This policy
      sets a Pod anti-affinity configuration on Deployments which contain an `app` label if it is
      not already present.
