    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Deployments to a Kubernetes cluster with multiple availability zones often need to
      distribute those replicas to align with those zones to ensure site-level failures
      do not impact availability. This policy ensures topologySpreadConstraints are defined, 
      to spread pods over nodes and zones. Deployments or Statefulsets with leass than 3 
      replicas are skipped.
