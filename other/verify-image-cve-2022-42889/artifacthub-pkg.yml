description: >-
  CVE-2022-42889 is a critical vulnerability in the Apache Commons Text library which could lead to arbitrary code executions and occurs in versions 1.5 through 1.9. Detecting the affected package may be done in an SBOM by identifying the "commons-text" package with one of the affected versions. This policy checks attested SBOMs in CycloneDX format of an image specified under `imageReferences` and denies it if it contains versions 1.5-1.9 of the commons-text package. Using this for your own purposes will require customizing the `imageReferences`, `subject`, and `issuer` fields based on your image signatures and attestations.
