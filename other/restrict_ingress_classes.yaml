      Ingress classes should only be allowed which match up to deployed Ingress controllers
      in the cluster. Allowing users to define classes which cannot be satisfied by a deployed
      Ingress controller can result in either no or undesired functionality. This policy checks
      Ingress resources and only allows those which define `HAProxy` or `nginx` in the respective
      annotation. This annotation has largely been replaced as of Kubernetes 1.18 with the IngressClass
      resource.
