  In some cases, an update to an existing resource should have downstream effects on a different resource in another Namespace. Rather than overwriting the target, the current state of the source can be concatenated to the target. This policy, triggered by an update to a source ConfigMap, concatenates that value of a target ConfigMap in a different Namespace.
