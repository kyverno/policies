      Labels are used as an important source of metadata describing objects in various ways
      or triggering other functionality. Labels are also a very basic concept and should be
      used throughout Kubernetes. This policy performs a simple mutation which adds a label
      `foo=bar` to Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
