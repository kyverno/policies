description: >-
  The `kubectl cp` command allows copying files between a local machine and a Pod's container, which may introduce security risks such as unauthorized data exfiltration or modification. This policy blocks the use of the `kubectl cp` command on all Pods, preventing any file transfers to or from containers while allowing other Pod operations.

  The `kubectl cp` command enables file transfers between a local machine and a Pod's container, which can pose security risks if misused. This policy enforces a blanket restriction on `kubectl cp` operations for all Pods in the cluster, ensuring no files can be copied to or from containers.
