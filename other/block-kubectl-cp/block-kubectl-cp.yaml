      The kubectl cp command is used to copy files between a local machine and a Pod's container. 
      While this functionality is useful for transferring data, it may introduce security risks, 
      such as unauthorized data exfiltration or modification. This policy blocks the use of the 
      kubectl cp command on all Pods with label `block-kubectl-cp=true`, ensuring that sensitive 
      workloads are protected from unintended file transfers. Other kubectl operations are unaffected, 
      allowing for normal Pod management while preventing potential misuse of file copy capabilities.
