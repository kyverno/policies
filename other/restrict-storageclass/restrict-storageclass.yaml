      StorageClasses allow description of custom "classes" of storage offered
      by the cluster, based on quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or
      custom policies determined by the cluster administrators. For shared StorageClasses
      in a multi-tenancy environment, a reclaimPolicy of `Delete` should be used to ensure
      a PersistentVolume cannot be reused across Namespaces. This policy requires
      StorageClasses set a reclaimPolicy of `Delete`.
