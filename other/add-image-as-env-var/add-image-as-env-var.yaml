      The Kubernetes downward API only has the ability to express so many
      options as environment variables. The image consumed in a Pod is commonly
      needed to make the application aware of some logic it must take. This policy
      takes the value of the `image` field and adds it as an environment variable
      to bare Pods and Deployments having no more than two containers. The `env` array must already exist for the policy
      to operate correctly. This policy may be easily extended to support other higher-level
      Pod controllers as well as more containers by following the established rules.
