      In addition to restricting the image registry from which images are pulled, in some cases
      and environments it may be required to also restrict which image repositories are used, 
      for example in some restricted Namespaces. This policy ensures that the only allowed
      image repositories present in a given Pod, across any container type, come from the
      designated list.
