    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Some containers must be built to run as root in order to function properly, but
      use of those images should be carefully restricted to prevent unneeded privileges.
      This policy blocks any image that runs as root if it does not come from a trustworthy
      registry, `ghcr.io` in this case.
