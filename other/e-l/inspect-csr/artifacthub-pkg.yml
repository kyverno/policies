description: >-
  The Kubernetes API includes a CertificateSigningRequest resource which can be used to generate a certificate for an entity. Because this API can be abused to create a long-lived credential, it is important to be able to audit this API to understand who/what is creating these CSRs and for what actors they are being created. This policy, intended to always be run in Audit mode and produce failure results in a Policy Report, inspects all incoming CertificateSigningRequests and writes out into the Policy Report information on who/what requested it and parsing the CSR to show the Subject information of that CSR resource.
