      By default, images that have already been pulled can be accessed by other
      Pods without re-pulling them if the name and tag are known. In multi-tenant scenarios,
      this may be undesirable. This policy mutates all incoming Pods to set their
      imagePullPolicy to Always. An alternative to the Kubernetes admission controller
      AlwaysPullImages.
