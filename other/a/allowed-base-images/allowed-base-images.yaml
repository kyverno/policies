    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Building images which specify a base as their origin is a good start
      to improving supply chain security, but over time organizations
      may want to build an allow list of specific base images which
      are allowed to be used when constructing containers. This policy ensures
      that a container's base, found in an OCI annotation, is in a cluster-wide
      allow list.
