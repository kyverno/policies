    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Pods running with a ServiceAccount are presented with a volume, containing
      the token, and volume mounts for all containers in the Pod. Applications that
      do not need to communicate with the Kubernetes API do not need a ServiceAccount and
      therefore limiting which Pods have access rights is important. Rather than, or in addition to,
      requiring that certain Pods disable mounting of a ServiceAccount, it is possible to silently
      remove this token if it has been presented. This policy ensures that Pods which do not
      have the label `corp.org/can-use-serviceaccount` and are consuming a ServiceAccount
      have that stripped away. It should be customized to restrict the scope of its operation as it
      will not distinguish between an explicitly-defined ServiceAccount or one provided by default.
