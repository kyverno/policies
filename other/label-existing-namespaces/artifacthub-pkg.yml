description: >-
  Namespaces which preexist may need to be labeled after the fact and it is time consuming to identify which ones should be labeled and either doing so manually or with a scripted approach. This policy, which triggers on any AdmissionReview request to any Namespace, will result in applying the label `mykey=myvalue` to all existing Namespaces. If this policy is updated to change the desired label key or value, it will cause another mutation which updates all Namespaces.
