  VerticalPodAutoscaler (VPA) is useful to automatically adjust the resources assigned to Pods.
  It requires defining a specific target resource by kind and name. There are no built-in
  validation checks by the VPA controller to ensure that the target resource is associated with it. 
  This policy ensures that the matching kind has a matching VPA.
