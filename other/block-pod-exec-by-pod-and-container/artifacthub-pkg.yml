description: >-
  The `exec` command may be used to gain shell access, or run other commands, in a Pod's container. While this can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, it could represent an attack vector and is discouraged. This policy blocks Pod exec commands to containers named `nginx` in Pods starting with name `myapp-maintenance`.
