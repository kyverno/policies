description: >-
  Pods running with a ServiceAccount are presented with a volume, containing the token, and volume mounts for all containers in the Pod. Applications that do not need to communicate with the Kubernetes API do not need a ServiceAccount and therefore limiting which Pods have access rights is important. Rather than, or in addition to, requiring that certain Pods disable mounting of a ServiceAccount, it is possible to silently remove this token if it has been presented. This policy ensures that Pods which do not have the label `corp.org/can-use-serviceaccount` and are consuming a ServiceAccount have that stripped away. It should be customized to restrict the scope of its operation as it will not distinguish between an explicitly-defined ServiceAccount or one provided by default.
