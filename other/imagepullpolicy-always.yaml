      By default, Kubernetes sets the `imagePullPolicy` for images which specify a tag
      to be `IfNotPresent`. In some cases, this may not be desired where the image
      could be rebuilt upstream. This sample policy ensures that all containers have
      their `imagePullPolicy` set to `Always`.
