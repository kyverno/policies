    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      NetworkPolicy is used to control Pod-to-Pod communication
      and is a good practice to ensure only authorized Pods can send/receive
      traffic. This policy checks incoming Deployments to ensure
      they have a matching, preexisting NetworkPolicy.
