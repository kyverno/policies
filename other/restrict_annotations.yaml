    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Some annotations control functionality driven by other cluster-wide tools and are not
      normally set by some class of users. This policy prevents the use of an annotation beginning
      with `fluxcd.io/`. This can be useful to ensure users either
      don't set reserved annotations or to force them to use a newer version of an annotation.
