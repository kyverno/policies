    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Scheduling non-system Pods to control plane nodes (which run kubelet) is often undesirable
      because it takes away resources from the control plane components and can represent
      a possible security threat vector. This policy prevents users from setting a toleration
      in a Pod spec which allows running on control plane nodes
      with the taint key `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`.
