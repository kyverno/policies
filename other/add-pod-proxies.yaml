      In restricted environments, Pods may not be allowed to egress directly to all destinations
      and some overrides to specific addresses may need to go through a corporate proxy.
      This policy adds proxy information to Pods in the form of environment variables.
      It will add the `env` array if not present. If any Pods have any of these
      env vars, they will be overwritten with the value(s) in this policy.
