      Verifying the integrity of resources is important to ensure no tampering has
      occurred, and in some cases this may need to be extended to certain YAML manifests
      deployed to Kubernetes. Starting in Kyverno 1.8, these manifests may be signed with
      Sigstore and the signature(s) validated to prevent this tampering while still allowing
      some exceptions on a per-field basis. This policy verifies Deployments are signed with
      the expected key but ignores the `spec.replicas` field allowing other teams to change just
      this value.
