      Clusters not initially installed with Kubernetes 1.22 may be vulnerable to an issue
      defined in CVE-2021-25740 which could enable users to send network traffic to locations
      they would otherwise not have access to via a confused deputy attack. This was due to
      the system:aggregate-to-edit ClusterRole having edit permission of Endpoints.
      This policy, intended to run in background mode, checks if your cluster is vulnerable
      to CVE-2021-25740 by ensuring the system:aggregate-to-edit ClusterRole does not have
      the edit permission of Endpoints.
