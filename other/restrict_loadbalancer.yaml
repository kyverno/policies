      Especially in cloud provider environments, a Service having type LoadBalancer will cause the
      provider to respond by creating a load balancer somewhere in the customer account. This adds
      cost and complexity to a deployment. Without restricting this ability, users may easily
      overrun established budgets and security practices set by the organization. This policy restricts
      use of the Service type LoadBalancer.
