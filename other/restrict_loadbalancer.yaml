      A Kubernetes service of type LoadBalancer typically requires the use
      of a cloud provider to realize the infrastructure on the backend.
      Doing so has the side effect of increased cost and potentially bypassing
      existing Ingress resource(s) which are preferred methods of issuing traffic
      to a Kubernetes cluster. The use of Services of type LoadBalancer should
      therefore be carefully controlled or restricted across the cluster.
