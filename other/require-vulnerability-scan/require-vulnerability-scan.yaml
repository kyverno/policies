      An important part of ensuring software supply chain integrity is performing
      periodic vulnerability scans on images. Initial scans as part of the build process
      is necessary, but as new vulnerabilities are discovered the scans must be refreshed.
      This policy ensures that images, signed with Cosign's keyless ability during a GitHub
      Actions workflow, have attested vulnerability scans not older than one week. This
      policy is expected to be customized based upon your signing strategy and applicable to
      the images you designate.
