    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The `exec` command may be used to gain shell access to a given Pod. While this can
      be useful for troubleshooting purposes, it could represent an attack vector and is discouraged.
      This policy blocks Pod exec commands to Pods beginning with the name
      `myapp-maintenance-`.
