  This Kyverno policy restricts the deployment of resources with names containing 'kubernetes-dashboard'.
  It ensures that resources with such names are not allowed to be deployed in the cluster to maintain security
  and prevent unauthorized access to the Kubernetes Dashboard.

  The policy checks the name of each resource and denies the request if it contains the string 'kubernetes-dashboard'.
  This helps in enforcing security policies and avoiding potential vulnerabilities.
