      In response to CVE-2021-44228 referred to as Log4Shell, a RCE vulnerability in the Log4j library, a
      workaround for versions 2.10 to 2.14.1 of the library is to set the environment
      variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to "true" which will disable the vulnerable
      feature. This policy will mutate all initContainers and containers in an
      incoming Pod to add this environment variable automatically.
