      In response to CVE-2021-44228 referred to as Log4Shell, a RCE vulnerability in the Log4j library, a
      partial yet incomplete workaround for versions 2.10 to 2.14.1 of the library is to set the environment
      variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to "true". While this does provide some
      benefit by limiting exposure, there are still code paths which can exploit
      this vulnerability. It is highly recommended to upgrade log4j as soon as possible.
      See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html for more details.
      This policy will mutate all initContainers and containers in an
      incoming Pod to add this environment variable automatically.
