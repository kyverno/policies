      Using digests can help in avoiding the pitfalls associated with mutable tags, 
      such as tags being overwritten with different images or potential malicious changes. 
      It effectively prevents pulling unintended or potentially harmful updates to the images.
      This policy ensures that images without a digest are not allowed.
