    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      In instances where a ClusterPolicy defines all the approved image registries
      is insufficient, more granular control may be needed to set permitted registries,
      especially in multi-tenant use cases where some registries may be based on
      the Namespace. This policy shows an advanced version of the Restrict Image Registries
      policy which gets a global approved registry from a ConfigMap and, based upon an
      annotation at the Namespace level, gets the registry approved for that Namespace.
