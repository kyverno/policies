  ExternalDNS, part of Kubernetes SIGs, triggers the creation of external DNS records in supported providers when the annotation`external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` is present. Like with internal DNS, duplicates must be avoided. This policy requires every such Service have a cluster-unique hostname present in the value of the annotation.
