displayName: Block a Cluster Admin/s from CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE any object in a Namespace
createdAt: "2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z"
description: >-
  In some cases we would want to block operations (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) of certain privileged users (i.e. cluster-admins), in a specific namespace.
          In this policy, Kyverno look for all user operations (`CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE`), on every object kind (Pod,Deployment,Route,Service,etc.), in the testnamespace namespace, and for the `clusterRole cluster-admin`. The `subject User testuser` is also mentioned so it won’t include all the cluster-admins in the cluster, but will be flexiable enough to apply only for a sub-group of the cluster-admins in the cluster.
