  It's common where policy lookups need to consider a mapping to many possible values rather than a static mapping. This is a sample which demonstrates how to dynamically look up an allow list of Namespaces from a ConfigMap where the ConfigMap stores an array of strings. This policy validates that any Pods created outside of the list of Namespaces have the label `foo` applied.
