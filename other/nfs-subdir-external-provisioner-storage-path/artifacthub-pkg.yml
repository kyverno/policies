description: >-
  The NFS subdir external provisioner project allows defining a StorageClass with a pathPattern, a template used to provision subdirectories on NFS exports. This can be controlled with an annotation on a PVC called `nfs.io/storage-path`. This policy ensures that if the StorageClass name `nfs-client` is used by a PVC, corresponding to the NFS subdir external provisioner, and if it sets the nfs.io/storage-path annotation that it cannot be empty, which may otherwise result in it consuming the root of the designated path.
