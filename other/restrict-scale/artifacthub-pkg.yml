description: >-
  Pod controllers such as Deployments which implement replicas and permit the scale action use a `/scale` subresource to control this behavior. In addition to checks for creations of such controllers that their replica is in a certain shape, the scale operation and subresource needs to be accounted for as well. This policy, operable beginning in Kyverno 1.9, is a collection of rules which can be used to limit the replica count both upon creation of a Deployment and when a scale operation is performed.
