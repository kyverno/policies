      Labels are important pieces of metadata that can be attached to
      just about anything in Kubernetes. They are often used to tag
      various resources as being associated in some way. Kubernetes
      has no ability to assign a series of "default" labels to incoming
      objects. This sample policy shows you how to assign one or multiple
      labels by default to any object you wish. Here it shows adding a
      label called custom-foo-label with value my-bar-default to resources
      of type Pod, Service, and Namespace but others can be added or removed as desired.
