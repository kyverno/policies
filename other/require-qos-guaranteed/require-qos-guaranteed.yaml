      Pod Quality of Service (QoS) is a mechanism to ensure Pods receive certain
      priority guarantees based upon the resources they define. When Pods define both
      requests and limits for both memory and CPU, and the requests and limits are equal
      to each other, Kubernetes grants the QoS class as guaranteed which allows them to run
      at a higher priority than others. This policy requires that all containers within a Pod
      run with this definition resulting in a guaranteed QoS. This policy is provided with the
      intention that users will need to control its scope by using
      exclusions, preconditions, and other policy language mechanisms.
