    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Liveness and readiness probes need to be configured to correctly manage a Pod's
      lifecycle during deployments, restarts, and upgrades. For each Pod, a periodic
      `livenessProbe` is performed by the kubelet to determine if the Pod's containers
      are running or need to be restarted. A `readinessProbe` is used by Services
      and Deployments to determine if the Pod is ready to receive network traffic.
      This policy validates that all containers have one of livenessProbe, readinessProbe,
      or startupProbe defined.
