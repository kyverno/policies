displayName: Drop All Capabilities in VPOL
description: >-
  Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. All capabilities should be dropped from a Pod, with only those required added back. This policy ensures that all containers explicitly specify the `drop: ["ALL"]` ability. Note that this policy also illustrates how to cover drop entries in any case although this may not strictly conform to the Pod Security Standards.
