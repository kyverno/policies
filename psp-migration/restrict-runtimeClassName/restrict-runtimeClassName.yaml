    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The runtimeClass field of a Pod spec defines which container engine runtime should be used.
      In the previous Pod Security Policy controller, defining restrictions on which classes were allowed
      was permitted. Limiting runtime classes to only those which have been defined can prevent
      unintended running states or Pods which may not come online. This policy restricts the runtimeClass
      field to the values `prodclass` or `expclass`.

  background: false

    - name: prodclass-or-expclass
