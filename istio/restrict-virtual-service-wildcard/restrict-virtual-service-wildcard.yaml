    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Virtual Services optionally accept a wildcard as an alternative
      to precise matching. In some cases, this may be too permissive as it
      would direct unintended traffic to the given resource. This
      policy enforces that any Virtual Service host does not contain a wildcard
      character and allows for more governance when a single mesh deployment 
      model is used.
