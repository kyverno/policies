description: >-
  One way sidecar injection in an Istio service mesh may be accomplished is by defining an annotation at the Pod level. Pods not receiving a sidecar cannot participate in the mesh thereby reducing visibility. This policy ensures that Pods cannot set the annotation `sidecar.istio.io/inject` to a value of `false`.
