    policies.kyverno.io/description: >- 
      Strict mTLS requires that mutual TLS be enabled across the entire service mesh, which
      can be set using a PeerAuthentication resource on a per-Namespace basis and, if set on
      the `istio-system` Namespace could disable it across the entire mesh. Disabling mTLS
      can reduce the security for traffic within that portion of the mesh and should be controlled.
      This policy prevents disabling strict mTLS in a PeerAuthentication resource by requiring
      the `mode` be set to either `UNSET` or `STRICT`.
